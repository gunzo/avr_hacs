@section personal_opinin_hwa My opinon (Hannes Wallnöfer, 111458)

	@subsection prj_status_hwa Status

	 The project is not finished. There is no real plan we could refer to as
	 ours and there never was.

	@subsection prj_history_hwa History

	 At the very beginning of this semester, I felt that two ideas where conveyed:

	 <ol>
	 	<li>
		    This semesters project is a big one, to allow us student to get better in
		    contact with project management and group work.
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
		    We will get the knowledge needed for the project, thought throughout the 
		    semester.
	 	</li>
	 </ol>

	 With both points in my mind, the semester started. Expecting that we will be
	 introduced to some kind project management system I forced my group to wait a
	 little bit with the planing. We where introduced to the Unified process. Then,
	 an introduction to UML and the different standard UML diagrams was given. We
	 then shortly returned to a somewhat abstract explanation of recursion in
	 project management.

	 At the same time, we learned about structuring C code with functions and 
	 macros and using header files.

	 I did not feel and still don't, that the information above was sufficient, to
	 get engaged in some kind of professional project management.

	 After those lessons in UML, structured C programming and some introduction
	 in Unified Process, the semester went on with technical lessons. We learned
	 about every peace of software and hardware we need to fulfill the project.

	 But, what is the project? Still demanding some patience for the other group 
	 members, I realized eventually that we will not learn more about project
	 management than we did. Half of the semester was already over at that time.

	 Now I can conclude, that point 1 in the list above, was not fulfilled to my
	 expectations. More about point two later.

	@subsection prj_srs_hwa The software requirements specification (SRS)

	 Relatively early of the semester, we got a document in digital form on 
	 campus net. This document was supposed to contain something called
	 Software Requirements Specification. We where supposed to elaborate on it and
	 present an iteration 1 in the class. At that time, it was my understating
	 that iteration one is the elaboration of one party on requirements given
	 by an other party. The result of this elaboration should be that the 
	 elaborating team has understood the requirements and its consequences 
	 before agreeing on implementing a system described by the requirements.
	 Our group agreed on describing the requirements in a more elaborate way in
	 our own words. During this process logical questions about how to interpret
	 certain aspects of the specification came to my and another group members
	 mind. This turned into a fiercely discussion which lasted for 3 hours.

	 Our group had strong problems on agreeing on an interpretation of the SRS.
	 We where in fact unable to meet the deadline for the hand in and asked our
	 teacher for a delay. We had the chance to see the presentation of the
	 other groups. The teacher seemed to be very happy with the groups 
	 presentations. I felt, that the groups did not solve logical problems we
	 encountered. At the end of the lessons, I asked the teacher if the 
	 SRS should have been understood as a guideline to create our own requirements.
	 The questions was answered with yes. It was already at that time apparent
	 that this also is not true, since the requirements about the communication
	 between the computer and  the rest of the hardware must be implemented
	 with the given package format. 

	 This means that our groups fierce discussion was based on something called a
	 requirement, which turned out to be a guideline. I want to make clear that
	 the mood in our group dropped significantly during this discussion.

	 I also would like to make clear again what I wrote in a E-mail to one of the
	 teachers and I would like to point to a trustworthy source:

	 <b>requirement</b>
	 noun
	 Definition:
	 something that you must do, or something you need

	 Source: http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/requirement?q=requirement

	@subsection prj_implement_hwa Implementation

	 After realizing that we will not get education in project management in a
	 for me understandable way, I decided to drop patience and started coding for
	 the C part. Resulting from different kinds of frustrations that arose in 
	 our group, we had a very hard time to plan at all. Several hours of talking
	 to our teachers did not resolve the problem completely. Tasks with deadlines
	 we did not understand added to the frustration.

	 To do something that should definitely be useful, I started writing very 
	 generic handlers for the timers. I realized that one group member was much
	 faster in getting the spi and uart divers working than I could write some
	 handlers for one timer. The same thing in Java, another group member had a gui
	 with access to database working one day after he said he would handle that 
	 part. I was impressed by my group members. Since I already had several 
	 semesters of education in C programming and experience with programing
	 micro controllers in both, C and assembler, I was amazed how fast code was
	 working for them. I then saw that the other groups where very fast too, in 
	 getting many basic thinks working. I felt stupid and was baffled by the
	 sheer speed problems where solved. I was baffled until I was told that most
	 groups took their code from examples, exercises or the Atmega32 data sheet.
	 This also explained why code was working very quickly, but the projects as
	 a hole seemed to grow very slow. It is the 28 of May. One week before writing
	 this, I encountered people who had problems understanding the code they where
	 responsible for.

	 I don't think this was the students fault. I felt, coping all the masses of
	 code was the only way for many to deal with the lack of knowledge in C and
	 partly Java. The deadlines for parts of the C code might have helped to get
	 the students to spit out more code, but I do not believe it was supporting
	 the cause of writing code them selfs and understanding code. At least, I felt
	 at some point like a rebel by trying to write all the code completely on my 
	 own.
	 
	 This leads me to the question, what was the purpose of this project?

	 I learned a lot about header files, prototyping, macros and definition by
	 searching the internet for best practice information. I also read a lot 
	 through avr libraries, avr libraries documentation and compiler documentation
	 to understand what I am doing. I could do so and learn something new, because
	 I already had a strong foundation. My class mates seemed to have to do things
	 without foundation, directly steeping into a higher level of coding. I think
	 not many will be happy of what they have learned this year, and I would like 
	 to express my depression about that too.

	@subsection prj_conclud_hwa Conclusion

	 <ol>
	 	<li>
	 	    Please remove the parts about project management completely from the 
		    agenda.
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
		    Design a much smaller project or let the students find a project for
		    them selfs. The later will support the interest, the students have,
		    to their project and is in my opinion more in the mind of Project
		    Based Learning (PBL, the reason I have chosen this university).
	 	</li>
		<li>
		    Use gained time to give a proper introduction into C programming. It
		    saddens me to see how this fundamental programing language was thought
		    this semester.
		</li>

@section prj_tools Project tools

	@subsection prj_tools_doxygen Doxygen

	 Doxygen is a documentation system for many different languages, notably Java 
	 and C. It is used in our project to generate an easy readable documentation
	 for our source code, both Java and C. This document is completely  generated
	 by doxygen. 
=======
@section about_docu About this documentation 

 This documentation was generated by doxygen. We can split it up into two 
 parts. The contend of the first part is completly written by the group. 
 It contains a more global view on the project and tries to reason and connect 
 things together.

 The second part starts with the class index. It's structure and the diagrams 
 are generated by doxygen. The descriptions in it have been generated from 
 our comments in the source code.

 Doxygen allows to document functions, macros, definitions, classes and more
 directly in the source code. This makes it easier to document code at the time
 it was written. It was tried to keep the documentation as abstract as 
 possible. This means, the goal was not to describe how the code works, but 
 what it does and how to use it.

 The functioning of the code was described with normal comments in the source 
 code.

 The source code for the C files can be found at the end of the every file
 description. Source code for the Java files can be found at the end of the
 documentaion.

@section about_colab About collaboration

 To share bigger files, mainly dropbox was used. For the source code of the
 Java and AVR code, git was used. To not be dependent on local servers and
 to allow access to source files from every point with internet access, we
 created accounts on github.com

 Here are the links to all the accounts:

 https://github.com/fragraider (Used as main account)
 https://github.com/ErikViking
 https://github.com/gunzo
 https://github.com/mkavardzhikova

 All accounts can be viewed without a password.

@section intro_sec Introduction

 This project aims to implement a very fast and straight forward way to do
 basic operations on a electrical equipment in a single room. This room is used
 sequentially by different people who wish to have their own setup when they use
 the room.
	
	@subsection basic_setup Basic setup capabilities

	 The system is able to do basic operations on electrical equipment, for example
	 switching the power on for an electrical device or create a short circuit
	 between two pins (This is needed to switch a computer on). 

	@subsection authent Authentication

	 Users will be able to activate their profile based on ID cards they recive as
	 part of the Home Automation Control System. After a short setup phase on the
	 computer side of this project, the user can wipe the card on the provided RFID
	 reader and enter a pin. If the information is correct, the settings for this
	 card will be applied.

	@subsection security Security

	 This system has very low security demands, since it is assumed that the
	 parties sharing the room know and trust each other. A four digit pin is
	 required to render abuse of the system by third parties harder. The
	 implemented level of security can not be considered to be more than a
	 help for the users not to activate the wrong settings, in case cards
	 where mixed. This helps to reassure that no device is turned on without the
	 knowledge of the actual beneficiary of one or more devices. This might result
	 in some power savings and keep user from frustration of possibly having to
	 deal with electrical devices they otherwise never use and are unsure on how
	 to operate them.
